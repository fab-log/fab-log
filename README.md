- Backend (still learning)

My focus is on database driven web applications like nursing management tools that can be run publicly or on local severs. 💻

At the moment I'm enrolled in an MIT xPRO program for full stack development. 🌱

I aim to provide clean code, easy to use applications without unnecessary distraction. ✔️
